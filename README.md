# Fashion Fiesta

Problem Statement:
Design an X-to-Earn dApp that encourages individuals to adopt sustainable behaviors by rewarding them with B3TR tokens for their sustainable actions in their day-to-day life. Examples might include a dApp that allows users to earn B3TR tokens by recycling, taking the bus, and more. 

Submission Requirements:
Be built on the VeChainThor blockchain
Be open source (and remain available as open source)
Include a short summary (<150 chars)
Include a full description (the problems it solves, how VeChain was used to achieve it)
Clearly highlight the main USP (unique selling proposition) in 2-3 easy-to-remember statements
Include a brief competitive analysis (including why past similar projects failed and how you aim to learn from their failures) and estimate the entire market and addressable market
Include an overview of the tokenomics (e.g. X-to-earn / incentives)
Show how the token is linked with the real world (Phygitals or NFTs)
Include an estimation of the amount of pre-seed money you would need to get to MVP
Define a go-to-market / roll out plan (to promote this venture and to acquire the first 5,000 users / clients)
Include a team slide, describing your team and backgrounds
Include a technical description (what SDKs were used, and what features of VeChain made this uniquely possible)
Include a link to the Canva slides used in the presentation (make sure you include a slide on your team, problem, solution etc). You must use Canva for your presentation.

* Anyone from around the world can connect to this mobile app to provide proof of their eco-friendly contribution. To prevent green-washing, the dApp would need to provide some instructions to standardize data-collection, users are required to support their uploads with data, for instance: proof by uploading a “before/after” photo, uploading a video of them doing the activity, or enabling 3rd party integrations to fitness applications such as Apple Health, Garmin, Cycling-related apps or EV mobile apps to provide proof of their activity.
* Your challenge is to define a value for their contributions, reward them, grow a community of like-minded individuals and to attract enterprise companies to be part of this ecosystem.

Our initiative aligns with VeBetterDAO’s goal of enabling individuals, NGOs, and enterprises to tokenize their sustainable actions. While we currently focus on individual consumers, we plan to expand to NGOs and enterprises in the future. By promoting sustainable clothing and raising awareness of the harms of unsustainable materials, we are contributing to the broader mission of fostering sustainability. Leveraging blockchain technology through the VeChainThor network ensures transparency and trust, with all user actions recorded immutably. This transparency allows users to verify their rewards and contributions, with smart contracts automating the distribution process based on verified actions like fabric detection and receipt analysis.
Our project’s unique implementation, which involves emulating social media to create a familiar, interactive platform, really sets us apart. Users can share their sustainable clothing purchases and inspire others in their geographic area to make eco-friendly choices. With a search function to find specific sustainable products, such as winter wear, users are empowered to make informed purchasing decisions.
The X-to-Earn model incentivizes users to adopt sustainable behaviors by rewarding them with B3TR tokens. These tangible rewards not only promote personal accountability but also contribute to fostering a culture of sustainability. As more users engage with sustainable clothing purchases, the demand for B3TR tokens increases, potentially boosting the token’s value. Partnerships with sustainable brands enable users to spend earned tokens on discounts or exclusive offers, creating a cycle that stimulates both spending and earning, enhancing token utility.
Community engagement is further encouraged through a dedicated community tab where users can share their purchases and participate in challenges like buying from the most sustainable brand of the month or earning the most views. This interaction strengthens the social aspect of sustainability and provides brands an opportunity for promotion, generating additional revenue streams.

Overall, our project not only reflects the values of VeBetterDAO but also pioneers a blockchain-based solution for promoting sustainability. By connecting users, brands, and tokens, it fosters sustainable growth and engagement, while laying the foundation for future advancements in the VeBetterDAO ecosystem.
